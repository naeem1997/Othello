# Othello 
A multiplayer strategy board game (also called Reversi).

So far, the game can be played with a human and a computer. Working on developing on getting a second human player as an opponent.
Also working on the GUI for the game, but can be played on Console for now :) 

Bugs:
 - board size is dynamic but rules of Reversi fail to apply once board size exceeds 12x12
