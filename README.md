# Othello 
A multiplayer strategy board game (also called Reversi).

So far, the game can be played with two people. Working on developing an AI computer version as opponent.
Working on the GUI for the game, but can be played on Console for now :) 

Bugs:
 - board size is dynamic but rules of Reversi fail to apply once board size exceeds 12x12
